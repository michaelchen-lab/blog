MOOCs often taught by industry experts and renown university professors — they are easily one of the best sources of knowledge on the internet. And the zero cost nature of these courses allows anyone to start learning any field, any time, with little friction.

Yet MOOCs have famously low completion rates, with estimates ranging from **3 to 10%**. Despite the world-class content they provide, students don’t finish courses. And we see this across other modes of online education with a similar teaching style to MOOCs. And let’s be honest, we all have a few Udemy and Coursera courses laying around unfinished.

Here’s the trillion dollar problem that MOOCs face today — **the lack of an accountability mechanism**.

The learning environment of MOOCs can be hostile and depressing to many. That amazing instructor behind the screen can’t help you when you’re stuck. There are no peers to go through the course with, and no words of encourage from anyone when things get tough. Completing a MOOC is tough and lonely — it’s no wonder we give up so easy.

To solve this, there are several type of services that provide the much needed accountability — which I broadly categorize as **Accountability-as-a-Service** (or AaaS).

And yes, I just made this term up. But I believe it’s necessary because AaaS providers often disguise themselves as something else, as we shall soon find out.

Here are 3 common forms of AaaS that exist today.

## 1. Education Institutions

Education institutions are defined as organisations which offer accreditation, thus broadly including high schools, colleges and coding bootcamps.

They excel at accountability — bootcamps have an average graduate rate of 92%, and that of US colleges is 60.4%. It is no wonder that they are by far the most common form of education. Education institutions offer accountability in 2 main ways:

### Community

A tight community of peers provide the much needed support through one’s learning journey. Having people around you who can relate to the struggles you go through can be the difference between earning your certification and giving up.

A Wharton School study found that loneliness leads to lower performance and decreased motivation. A circle of learning companions is the perfect solution for staving off feelings of isolation and for boosting morale. 

### Price

Ironically, the price tag itself is a form of accountability. If you’ve paid thousands to join a coding bootcamp, you’ll be far more motivated than if you paid nothing for a Coursera course. And this has got nothing to do with the quality of education, this is purely about how sunken cost creates accountability.

Of course, I am not attempting to reduce education institutions to simply an accountability mechanism. For example, they serve as stepping boards for students to gain employment, and their associated credentials serve as a form of signaling, that *hey, I know my shit*. Nonetheless, AaaS is a big (often unspoken) part of their value to students.

## 2. Accountability Partners

They are typically learners on the same journey as you, working towards a similar goal.

Having an accountability partner has the same benefits as being part of a community. They keep you on track towards your goals and you do the same for them. Exchanging ideas and solving each others roadblocks are often part of the experience.

Much unlike education institutions, there is no monetary cost because such an arrangement creates an inherently win-win situation, whereby both parties achieve their objective of being accountable. The sunken cost effect is a powerful source of motivation, which those who choose this route will miss out on, but a strong sense of camaraderie and mutual support can more than make up for it.

There are several services out there that helps one find such a partner, one of them is *Supporti*. However, none have gained widespread adoption. And I suspect this is because this category’s biggest competitor is *friends* — if I wanted an accountability partner, the first people I turn to will be those I already know.

This segment is still immature. But perhaps one day, we’ll see a Tinder for accountability.

## 3. Coaches

They motivate students to keep going and set expectations for them.

Often, coaches disguise their AaaS service as something else. For example, personal trainers market themselves as providing tailored fitness plans, ensuring good posture, etc. But let's be honest, most of us don't really need someone by our side while running on the threadmill. We're fine by ourselves. But making an appointment with a trainer forces you to go to the gym; their mere presence motivates you to run faster and lift heavier.

Productivity/business/accountability coaches can do the same for learning. They may add minimal value to one's education, but they ensure learning happens.

## MOOC 2.0

MOOCs have almost perfected the delivery of educational content. But they have not solved the human element of learning — accountability. They’ve managed to learners across the globe to the staring line, but not the finishing line.

Currently, the only way to raise completion rates is through 3rd party AaaS providers like accountability partners and coaches. For the more well off, expensive bootcamps and higher education take the place of MOOCs, despite teaching similar content.

How might we integrate AaaS into MOOCs as a first party service? Finding the answer to this question will finally allow MOOCs to live up to its hype of transforming higher education.
