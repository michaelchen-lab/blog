MOOCs often taught by industry experts and renown university professors—they are easily one of the best sources of knowledge on the internet. And the zero cost nature of these courses ensures anyone can start learning at any time with little friction.

Yet MOOCs have famously low completion rates, with estimates ranging from 3 to 10%. We all have a few Udemy and Coursera courses sitting around unfinished.

Here's the problem—they have no accountability mechanism.

The instructor behind the screen can't help when you're stuck. There are no peers to go through the course with you and words of encourage from anyone when things get tough. Completing a MOOC is tough and lonely—it's no wonder we give up so easy.

To solve this, there are several services which provide the much needed accountability mechanism—which I broadly categorize under Accountability as a Service.

And yes, I just made this term up. But I believe it's necessary because AaaS providers often disguise themselves as something else, which I touch on later in this article.

Here are some different types of AaaS that exist today.

## Education Institutions

This subcategory is characterized by institutions which offer accreditation, which includes high schools, colleges and coding bootcamps.

By far the most expensive, they offer accountability in 3 ways:

### Community

A tight community of peers provide the much needed support through one's learning journey. Having people around you who can relate to the struggles you go through can be the difference between earning your certification and giving up.

A Wharton School study found that loneliness leads to lower performance and decreased motivation. Learning companions are the perfect solution to staving off feelings of isolation.

### Price

Ironically, the price tag itself is a form of accountability. If you paid thousands to join a coding bootcamp, you'll be far more motivated than if you paid nothing for a Coursera course. And this has got nothing to do with the quality of education, this is purely about how sunken cost creates accountability.

Of course, education institutions aren't purely an AaaS. Student use them as stepping boards to gain employment and graduates can wave their credentials as a form of signaling, that *hey, I know my shit*.

## Accountability Partners

They are typically learners on the same journey as you, working towards a similar goal.

Having an accountability partner has the same benefits as being part of a community. They keep you on track towards your goals and you do the same for them. Exchanging ideas and solving each others roadblocks are often part of the experience.

Much unlike education institutions, there is no monetary cost because such an arrangement is an inherently win-win situation, since both parties achieve their objective of being accountable. The sunken cost effect is a powerful source of motivation, which those who choose this route will miss out on, but a strong sense of camaraderie and mutual support can more than make up for it.

There are several services out there that helps one find such a partner, one of them is Supporti. However, none have gained widespread adoption. I suspect this is because this category's biggest competitor is friends—if I wanted an accountability partner, the first people I turn to will be those I already know.

This segment is still immature. But perhaps one day we'll see a Tinder for accountability.

## Coaches

They motivate students to keep going and set expectations for them.

Often, coaches disguise their AaaS service as something else. For example, personal trainers market themselves as providing tailored fitness plans, ensuring good posture, etc. But let's be honest, most of us don't really need someone by our side while running on the threadmill. We're fine by ourselves. But making an appointment with a trainer forces you to go to the gym; their mere presence motivates you to run faster and lift heavier.

Productivity/business/accountability coaches can do the same for learning. They might not add any value to one's education, but they ensure learning happens.

## A new generation of MOOCs

Accountability is what MOOCs are missing. And the only way for students to get it is through 3rd party AaaS providers like accountability partners and coaches.

How might we integrate AaaS into MOOCs? Finding the answer to this question will finally allow MOOCs to live up to its hype of transforming higher education.
