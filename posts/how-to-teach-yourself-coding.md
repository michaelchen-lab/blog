How did you learn coding yourself? How should I start programming? I hear these questions often enough to warrant a blog post. I'm no expert at data science or web development (yet), but my attempts at self-learning (with only free resources) has gotten me two internships so far. This guide to self-learning is a result of what worked and what didn't work in my experience. 

## Why This Guide?

(Write later)

## Step 1: Define an End Goal

This long-term target is used as a guiding beacon for your learning journey. It reminds you of *why* you are learning to code, which keeps you motivated. Software engineering is a gigantic field. Your end goal tells you which languages, frameworks, technologies, etc, you need to learn.

While your end goal need not be hyper-specific, it must be measurable or observable. Having too vague of an end goal is like being a cross-country runner and not knowing where the finishing line is.

**Good Examples**
1. Land a job as a junior software engineer
2. Build a Twitter clone

**Bad Examples**
1. Become good enough to be a junior software engineer
1. Become proficient at web development

Words like "good enough" and "proficient" is difficult to measure. Having a vague goal introduces uncertainties into your self-learning journey, making it needlessly harder.

## Step 2: Learn the Basics of a Language

Google for the most popular programming language for area of interest. For example, if your end goal relates to data science, you should pick Python. Then find an online courses/tutorials that teach you the absolute basics of that language. There are a shit load of tutorials for the fundamentals of every major language. Just pick any popular option and start learning.

The goal of this step is to learn the super basic stuff like variables and functions, so aim to finish this in less than 10 hours. Once you can create a simple BMI calculator, move to the next step.

Exception: If web development your area of interest, you need to learn JavaScript, HTML and CSS, since all 3 are considered fundamental knowledge. Aim for less than 20 hours on this.

## Step 3: Start a Project
