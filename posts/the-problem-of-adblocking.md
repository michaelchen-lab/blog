According to Wikipedia, adblocking is a software capability for blocking or altering online ads in a web browser. This often comes in the form of a browser extension, such as [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/).

## The Problem

Why do some users go through the hassle of installing adblocking extensions? Because online ads suck. While most websites moderate their use of ads, some sites shamelessly bombard users with intrusive ads. To the point where there seems to be more ads than content on the screen.
